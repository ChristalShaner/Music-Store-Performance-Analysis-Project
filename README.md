# Music-Store-Performance-Analysis-Project
This project builds a star-schema dataset for a fictional music store, including sales, products, customers, and dates. It powers a Power BI report with an overview dashboard and drilldowns: one highlighting a win (instrument growth) and another revealing an opportunity (low accessory attach rates).
